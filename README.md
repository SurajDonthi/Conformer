# Conformer: Convolution-augmented Transformer for Speech Recognition
Transformers have offered breakthrough performances in the recent years in NLP and have also shown decent results for Speech Processing tasks. However, with Convolutional architectures performing significantly well on Speech Processing tasks, the addition of a Convolutional module to a traditional Transformer architecture outperforms all previous architectures! Conformer combines the best of Convolutions & Transformers.

This repository implements the Conformer Architecture in PyTorch!
